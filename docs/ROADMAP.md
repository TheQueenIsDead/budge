# Roadmap

A messy group of functions that I would like Budge to be able to perform for me

 - [ ] Add the ability to categorise transactions (To help inform spending of a budget)
 - [ ] The ability to easily label and merge merchants
 - [ ] The ability to filter out transactions that are simply shuffling money around.
 - [ ] The ability to add assets and keep track of items
 - [ ] A net worth calculator
 - [ ] Better reactivity using HTMX
 - [ ] Better error logging and handling for the user
 - [ ] Installable binaries with goreleaser
